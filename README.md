# ðŸ“œ Collaborative Poem

A poetic experiment in collectivity, connection, and spatial presence.  
Each participant receives just a fragment of a larger poem â€” incomplete on its own.  
Only by coming together in space can the full poem be read and felt.

## âœ¨ Concept

- Each device receives a **vertical slice** of a multi-line poem.
- The poem fragments are **distributed live** via WebSockets.
- Users are placed in a **dynamic 1-row grid** (e.g. 1Ã—N layout).
- A **shared view** shows the current arrangement of participants and their fragments.
- The experience emphasizes **cooperation**, **diversity**, and **togetherness**.
- The poem is by Sally Author (https://www.sullytheauthor.com/2024/06/28/threads-of-unity-poem/)
